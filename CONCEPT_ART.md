# Concept Art & Animation Ideas for Twelve Stones: Ephod Quest

## Overall Style

- **Palette**: Desert Sand (#E9D5B3), Clay Brown (#8B6F47), Olive Green (#6B7A4F), Pure Gold (#FFD700), Antique Gold (#C5A572).
- **Themes**: Unity, discovery, heart. No violence—focus on joy, mentorship, nature.

## Key Visual Elements

### Characters (Avatars & Elders)
- **Avatars**: 12-29 years old, diverse skin/hair/eyes/builds. Rounded faces, big eyes, simple clothing (tribal robes in earth tones).
  - Example: Ezra (Reuben) - Lean build, curly black hair, brown eyes, warm smile.
- **Elders**: Wise, smiling NPCs with beards/robes, gold accents.
- **Animations**: Idle (gentle breathing), happy (heart glow), walking (smooth bounce).

### Environments
- **Quest Scenes**: Ancient landscapes (caves, hills, valleys) with gold pillars, blue/purple curtains, 7-flame lamps.
  - Reuben: Rocky cave with glowing butterflies.
  - Judah: Sunlit hillside with praise echoes.
- **Finale**: Courtyard with woven ephod (gold threads, 12 stones glowing).

### UI & Effects
- **Buttons**: Rounded, gold borders, hover glow.
- **Transitions**: Fade with light bloom, stone collection sparkles.
- **Mini-Games**: Animated taps (ripples), rhythms (beating hearts), patterns (connecting lines).

## Animation Concepts
- **Logo Intro** (Implemented): Title fades in, stones float up/down in sequence, symbolizing unity.
- **Quest Transitions**: Camera pans over landscapes, characters wave hello.
- **Ephod Weave**: Stones drop into place, gold threads animate weaving, light blooms on people.
- **Nature Facts**: Animals/bugs animate (butterfly wings flutter, bee waggle dance).

## Creative Flavor
- **Unity Theme**: Stones connect with light beams, characters hold hands in finale.
- **Discovery**: Hidden verses "reveal" with scroll unrolling animation.
- **Heart**: Subtle heart icons pulse during co-op moments.

This captures the calming, educational, co-operative spirit—ready for an artist to bring to life!
