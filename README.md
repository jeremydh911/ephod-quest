# Twelve Stones — Ephod Quest

> *"For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."*
> — Proverbs 2:6

A 3D co-operative biblical adventure game built with **Godot Engine 4.3**.
Players choose from **12 tribes × 4 avatars** (48 unique characters) and journey
through tribal quests, collect gemstones, memorise scripture, and discover
creation science — ending with every tribe weaving together the high-priest's
breastplate in a shared finale.

## Vision

**No violence. No stats. No loot.**
Only heart, unity, and discovery.

Each of the 12 tribes has a unique landscape, elder, mini-games, collectible
gemstone, quest verse, and a nature-science fact — experienced in 10-20 hours
of meaningful play.

├── sprites/
│   ├── characters/     # Tribal avatars and elders
│   ├── backgrounds/    # World biomes

```

### Asset Organization

The raw images are in `assets/sprites/raw/`. To organize them:

1. **Manual Method**: Inspect each `img_01.jpg` etc. and rename/move to appropriate folders (see asset structure below).

2. **Free Tools**:
   - **Advanced Renamer** (Windows/macOS): Batch rename with EXIF data, add prefixes/suffixes.
   - **Bulk Rename Utility** (Windows): Powerful renaming with patterns.
   - **Ant Renamer** (Cross-platform): Open-source, supports metadata.

   Example: Use Bulk Rename Utility to add prefixes like "reuben_avatar_" then manually sort.

3. **Godot Tool**: Run `scripts/AssetOrganizer.gd` in editor (has predefined mapping, update as needed).

### Rendering Worlds and Objects

Use the modular rendering system:

- **Characters**: `Character.create("reuben", "naomi", "avatar")`
- **Worlds**: `WorldGenerator.generate("desert", self)`
- **Items**: `Inventory.create_pickup("sardius", position)`

Load organized images into SpriteFrames for animations.
